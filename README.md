ChatAppFaceID is a web chat (or Bulletin Board System) that allow user exchanging messages with other users through chat room ( or public message board). Each user has two options to log into the chat room. They can either log in by using their google account or using the smiling facial recognition.

- Log in by Google Account

  - When the user succesfully logs in by using his/her google account, they will see their `Google profile photo, ID, username, and email address`. Then, they can join the chat room by clicking `Home` in the navigation bar.
  - You should see your name in the `Online Users` box and the `Hello, "your name"`. You can begin to chat.

- Log in by Smiling Facial Recognition
  - When this feature is chosen, the live webcame is turned on. It will only allow you to login when it catches your smiling face.
  - When you click on `Acccount` in the nav bar, it will not display anything.
